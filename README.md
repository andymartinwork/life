# Life

This is a project about Cellular Automata.

Life currently consists of a grid, with randomly placed Cells on it.
Time moves over the grid and executes each Cell's tick function which reads instructions and executes them.

Things are at an early stage, so the only thing they can currently do is move.

Proposed features:

* Ability of a Cell to mutate and change the order of instructions
* Ability of a Cell to mutate the instructions themselves
* Addition of food and death rays. Basic survival stuff.
